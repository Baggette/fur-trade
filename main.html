      <p id="when">
      The fur trade in North America is belived to have been started in around the 1600's and it continued for about 250 more years.<br> 
      </p>
      <p>The major driving forces behind the fur trade was the need for <a id="what">beaver</a> skin and buffalo hides. This was due to a fasion craze in Europe, many Europeans wanted to wear felt <a id="why">hats</a> made out of bevear fur. The French gave Indigenous peoples European goods such as iron axes, glass beads and other miscellaneous items.</p>

      <p>The fur trade was a very important industry in <a id="who">France</a>, so France sent settlers to Canada to trade with the Indigenous people. The French also sent missionarys to convert indigenous people into christians.</p>
      <p>The British wanted to make money from the fur trade too, so they created the Hudsons Bay Company in 1670. The Hudsons Bay company gained control of Rupert's Land and this was quite a large area on the continent. Similar to the French the British gave items to indigenous people for trade.</p>

      <p>Near the late 1700's indigenous people who lived in the plains were exchanging beaver pelts and horses to The Hudsons Bay and The Northwest fur traders for European goods.<br> <br> <a id="where">These</a> trades were usually held around a few different villages around the Missouri river.
      <br>There were many miscellaneous items that were exchanged such as produce, horses, furs and pelts and whiskey, guns, iron goods, trade beads, and a few beaver traps from Canadian traders.
